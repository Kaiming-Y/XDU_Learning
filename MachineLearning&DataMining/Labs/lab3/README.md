第三次实验是使用基于CNN的神经网络架构（VGG、GoogLeNet、ResNet）完成海面船只的图片二分类任务，代码见：[Kaiming-Y/images_binary_classification: The CNN-based model architecture implements the image binary classification task on the ship data set. Models that have been implemented include: VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet (github.com)](https://github.com/Kaiming-Y/images_binary_classification)
